A modern, responsive web dashboard to monitor and manage your Proxmox server environment. This project provides an intuitive interface to visualize server status, virtual machines (VMs) and containers (CTs), ZFS storage info, backup history, and more.

## Features

- Overview of server health and resource usage (CPU, RAM)
- List and status of Virtual Machines and Containers
- ZFS pool information and statistics
- Storage devices overview
- Backup history tracking
- Interactive charts powered by Chart.js
- Clean and modern UI with FontAwesome icons
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3 with modern responsive design
- JavaScript for dynamic content loading and charts
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for rendering resource usage graphs
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for scalable vector icons
- Google Fonts (Inter) for clean typography

## Current status
Currently, the dashboard loads data from a pre-existing JSON file. In the future, it will be enhanced to interact directly with Proxmox APIs to provide live data and control capabilities.
